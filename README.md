##  Designing  
The UI has be designed by me in Adobe XD. The motivation for the UI has been taken from [here](https://quadangles.com/). Its not an exact copy as I have tried to make certain changes and tried to make the UI on my own by just looking at it once or twice. But still, no credits to me. I have add certain flavours of my own like the illustrations and changing the color pallete a bit.
