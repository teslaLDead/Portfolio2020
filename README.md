# Portfolio 2020

A personal portfolio for the year 2020. 

## Motivation

To create a portfolio highlighting my work and ideas. A space to present myself. The creation of this website will help me showcase my skills, create and maintain a blog and maybe help me get more work(jobs). Also this project will help me get more comfortable with creating websites and applications. This is a personal *development* challenge for me.


##  Objectives

*   Create a cool looking website that helps me promote myself.
*   Showcase my skills, talent and work.
*   Create a space to share my own ideas(in the form of blog) and knowledge.
*   Further enhance my development skills.

##  Designing  
The UI/UX has be created by me in Adobe XD. The motivation for the UI has been taken from [here](https://quadangles.com/). Its not an exact copy as I have tried to make certain changes and tried to make the UI on my own by just looking at it once or twice. But still, no credits to me. I have added certain flavours of my own like adding animated illustrations, changing the color pallete a bit and playing with certain design elements.
